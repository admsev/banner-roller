== Welcome to Rails

Storing All the clicks and shows in database is prodigally.
In real life there should be Redis for last day and Daily, Weekly, Monthly stats in database.

== Getting Started

1. It'd be nice use Mina gem for deployment

2. Currently images are stored on local filesystem. Use "fog" gem for Amazon S3.
